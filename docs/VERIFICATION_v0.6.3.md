# Vaulta v0.6.3 Verification (Header Cleanup)

Date: 2026-02-20
Tester: Agent Subsystem

## Tested
- [x] Header only shows Brand + Vault/Map toggle + Capture
- [x] Capture works (button + 'c')
- [x] Map/Vault toggle works
- [x] No console errors

## Notes
- Analyzed via playwright automated visual review. Unused Lucide icons were stripped cleanly from the JSX leaving a smooth minimal flex row. Quick capture keybind triggers perfectly.
